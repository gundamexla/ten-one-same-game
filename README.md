# ten-one-same-game
(A game in which you press a button to score when the number of digits in 10 and the number of digits in 1 are the same.)

The first time you press the button, the word 'GAME START' appears on the LCD and the game starts. Once the game is started, the numbers go up and loop rapidly on the two-digit FND, and if you press the button when the digits 10 and the digits 1 are the same, the green LED will turn on and the score will go up. Conversely, when the press button that  digits 10 and the digits 1 are different, the red LED turns on, and the LCD screen displays the phrase 'GAME OVER' and the game returns to its initial state after 5 seconds.
